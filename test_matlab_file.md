## Matlab Overview

Matlab is a software used by engineers around the globe to perform mathematical computations, create graphs or models, manipulate matrices, and much more.

## Setup and Basics

## Basic plotting

Matlab offers a number of plotting capabilities.  The basic 2-D line plot requires the use of vectors, which can be created by using the form (starting point):(increment):(ending point), so the vector
```
  my_vector = 0:5:100
``` 
creates a vector starting at zero, ending at 100, which is incremented up by 5.
